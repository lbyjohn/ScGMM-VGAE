# Evaluating the Novel Clustering Method ScGMM-VGAE for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data
## Abstract
**Background: The fundamental step in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) computational analysis is cell clustering, which groups sets of cells into meaningful subpopulations without using truth labels. A Gaussian mixture model-based variational graph autoencoder (scGMM-VGAE) was developed to cluster the scRNA data in our previous study. However, its performance evaluation and compatibility with imputation have not been fully studied.
